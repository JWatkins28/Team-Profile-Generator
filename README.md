# **Team Profile Generator**

## **Description**

This project will let you create a cleanly formatted team roster based on your user input. You add a Manager, and then any number of Engineers and Interns. Once you're finished filling out the prompts the program will generate an HTML page to the "dist" folder with your generated page. There's also CSS to go along with it.
